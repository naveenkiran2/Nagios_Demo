Review File Locations
There are a number of files that you should review, both their location and their content.  It is important that you review these because if you change a file location you may have to modify a number of additional files that depend on that location.

Main Configuration File
The main configuration file for nagios is /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg.  This is the file that contains paths to the other configuration files.

Configuration Directory
The directory /etc/nagios/objects contains much of the information needed for modify objects.

commands.cfg  contacts.cfg  localhost.cfg  printer.cfg  switch.cfg  templates.cfg  timeperiods.cfg  windows.cfg

Review the contents of each of these files.  If you change the name of any you will need to make changes to at least the nagios.cfg, possibly others.

Log File
An archives directory is created in /var/log/nagios and the main log is here:
/var/log/nagios/nagios.log

Resource File
/etc/nagios/resource.cfg

Plugins and CGIs
The scripts for plugins and the cgi files that provide data for the web interface are found here:
